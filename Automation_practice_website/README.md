Within this repository, I embark on a journey to test various automated test cases provided by the [Automation Practice website](https://automationexercise.com/test_cases).

This project presents an excellent opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience and sharpen my skills in testing methodologies and techniques.

As I dive into this experience, **my goal** is to become proficient in executing and validating test cases using Python(for now :books::computer:)
